# Registration and organization of a beauty salon
A program to register the prices of the different services (hairstyle, makeup and haircut) and the days to schedule an appointment at the salon.

## Program functionality 
### Prices:
* The idea is that in addition to scheduling appointments, the program can have a record of the costs of each service provided in the salon, in order to keep a complete record and a good organization.
* The program will need to have a record of the service, what it includes and the cost, for example:
    1. Makeup      -  90 US$ 
    2. Hairstyle   -  70 US$ 
    3. Haircut     -  40 US$
    
### The idea is to be able to organize appointments and prices in a useful program for the salon so:
* The salon is open from Monday to Friday from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm on the last appointment.
* The person requesting an appointment will know how he/she has to get to the salon that day in order to have everything ready, and the appointment will be scheduled with the following data:
1. Name of the customer (first and last name)
2. Required service
3. Date
4. Hour
